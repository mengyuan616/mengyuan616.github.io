						<h2>About me</h2>
						<p>I am a multimedia journalist currently based in the Bay Area. I am also pursuing my master’s degree in journalism at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
						<p>I love to write, code and film.</p>
						<p>I’ve been writing-focused my whole college life, but I’m also equipped with basic coding and data analysis skills that support my passion for reporting data-driven stories.</p>
						<p>I’ve had media experience in both China and the U.S., including interning at Caixin Media and being a student reporter at <a href="https://thedailytexan.com/staff_name/mengyuan-dong/">The Daily Texan</a>.</p>
						<p>My reporting interests include climate, recycling policies, public health and social justice.</p>
