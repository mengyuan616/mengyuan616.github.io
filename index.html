						<h2 id="aboutText">Hello, <br>I'm Mengyuan.</h2>
						<p>I am a writer and a data journalist based in the Bay Area, specializing in telling stories through data analysis and visualization. I recently completed my master's degree in journalism from the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
						<p>Previously, I was an editorial intern and a Google News Initiative fellow at Bay City News, a Bay Area news outlet, where I wrote features and breaking news stories on various local issues. I also produced standalone data projects as an intern at Caixin Media, a national and investigative reporting publication in China.</p>
						<p>At UC Berkeley, I immersed myself in data visualization, narrative writing and open-source investigations. I developed projects on electric vehicle charging infrastructure, local recycling policies and the life of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. Additionally, I sought to enhance my coding skills by taking courses at the School of Information, where I honed my abilities in Python and R.</p>
						<p>With my reporting and technical skills, I can create stories and data projects from beginning to end. And I'm always looking to explore fresh angles and add depth to stories through a data lens. My reporting interests include climate, public health and social justice and Asian American communities.</p>
