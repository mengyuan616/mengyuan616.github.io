						<h2 id="aboutText">Hello, <br>I'm Mengyuan.</h2>
						<p>I am a writer and a data journalist based in the Bay Area, currently a reporting intern for Bay City News. I am also pursuing my master’s degree in journalism at the University of California, Berkeley.</p> 
						<p>I had been writing-focused my college life and got into data journalism when I took a class in R during my junior year. I’m equipped with data analysis and visualization skills that support my passion for exploring fresh angles and adding depth to a story from a data perspective.</p>
						<p>I’ve had living and reporting experience in both China and the U.S. My reporting interests include climate, recycling policies, public health and social justice.</p>
